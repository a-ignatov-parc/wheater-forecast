# Overview

This is a model challenge that will show us if you, as a new member of our team, are capable of performing basic tasks.

We need to implement the `WeatherForecast` component, which will be responsible for displaying information from the api.

Use generated API calls from `api/index.ts` to get weather forecasts.

Forecasts should only be loaded when the user has requested them by clicking the `Load` button in the `WeatherForecast` component.

The text in the `WeatherForecast` component should display information about which forecast will be loaded.

In addition, the business is considering adding new forecasts in the future that will work in a similar way. For example, a forecast for a specific city or other time period.

# Goals

The main purpose of this test is to check the following:

1. How do you work with the requirements.
2. How do you work with styling and components composition.
3. Finally, how do you work with asynchronous data in the context of the ReactJS lifecycle, error handling, and configuration.

# Recomendations

- Create a fork of this sandbox, and when you're done, send us back the link with the result. If you are not happy with the codesandbox, you can do it the way you prefer.
- You can use whatever is convenient for styling your components. Either it is a css-in-js library, or good old css.
- The exact colors and font styles are not important.
- Don't forget that component configuration can be updated and it can be removed from the page.
- The `api` directory can't be changed as it is created by a third party service.
